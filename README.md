# 🛡️ DevSecOps Day 2 Lab – Building My Foundation

Welcome to my **Day 2 Challenge** of the **30-Day Journey to Becoming an Expert DevSecOps Cloud Engineer** 🚀  
This project focuses on understanding **what DevSecOps truly means** and how to start applying security-first practices in every stage of software development.

## 🌍 About This Project

This repository represents the beginning of my practical journey into **DevSecOps**, where I’m learning to integrate **Security + Development + Operations** as one continuous, automated, and collaborative process.

**Day 2 Focus Areas:**
- Understanding the cultural shift from DevOps → DevSecOps  
- Setting up a secure GitHub repository  
- Creating a `SECURITY.md` file for responsible vulnerability reporting  
- Establishing branch protection rules  
- Designing my first **DevSecOps pipeline** diagram

## 🧠 What is DevSecOps?

**DevSecOps** means embedding security throughout the software development lifecycle — from design and coding to deployment and monitoring.

It’s not an afterthought — it’s **baked in from Day 1.**

**Core Principles:**
1. 🔁 **Shift Left Security** — Catch issues early  
2. ⚙️ **Automation First** — Automate tests & checks  
3. 👥 **Shared Responsibility** — Everyone owns security  
4. 📈 **Continuous Monitoring** — Detect, respond, and improve  

> 💡 *DevSecOps = Speed + Security + Collaboration*
